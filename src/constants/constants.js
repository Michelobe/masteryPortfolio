    description: "This website was created with HTML and CSS.  The intent was to clone a real website using just a picture of the length of the website.  It is responsive as you can see.  Most of the animations are pure CSS, with the exception of a single use of JavaScript for a smoother menu. I have included links to both the website as well as github, enjoy.",

    title: 'Handyman Website',
    description:"This website was created with HTML and CSS as well.  I designed this website as a mobile-first website, leaving it very clean and straight to the point.  The object was to convey contact info rapidly upon loading the site.  It was projected that out in the field, users would most likely only have their phones/tablets on them.  This particular company works by association, so mobile-first was the way to go.",

    title: 'Medical Care Website',
    description: "This project was a group collaboration with a total of five developers participating.  We used Trello to keep track of completed tasks, along with gitHub for version control considering our team was located all around the United States.  The task was random, a hospital website.  We had a two week timeline, and were able to complete on time.  I still work closely with this team as we push eachother to progress.",
